<h1>Servant of Niris Privacy Policy</h1>

The Servant of Niris bot is a Discord bot used for distributing informational graphics about Destiny 2, along with a few sub-features like being able to post memes and cat pictures. This bot is actively invited to servers to be used and responds to commands, and can auto-post utilizing Discord’s announcement channels. 

<h3>The basic information we collect</h3>
The Servant of Niris bot collects your username and user ID. The bot also collects the server name and server ID.  
<h3>Why this information is collected</h3>
	This information is collected for the bot to work. Your username and ID allow the bot to receive the commands you give it, and the server name and ID allow the bot to join your server and know where it’s working. 
<h3>Logs & Database Information</h3>
	The Servant of Niris bot has a secure database only accessible by a few people. This database houses non-private information, such as the previously mentioned server name and ID, that can be seen by anyone that joins the server as an individual. The logs and database allow those maintaining the bot to see permission updates, prefix changes, what features are turned on or off for the bot, and any failures that occur when trying to run a command. We do not share any information collected with outside/third parties. 
<h3>Server settings</h3>
The Servant of Niris bot requires access to several settings to work properly. 
<li>Manage Webhooks: Servant uses Discord’s announcement channels to use auto-post, which requires webhooks. Servant of Niris does not manage any other webhook besides its own. 
<li>Read Text Channels & See Voice Channels: Servant of Niris uses these settings to be able to see the commands you run. 
<li>Send Messages: Servant of Niris uses this to be able to respond to commands given. 
<li>Manage Messages: Servant of Niris uses this explicitly to delete it’s own messages and your last typed message when running a command with the bot. We do not use Servant to remove or purge other messages. 
<li>Embed Links: When a command has a link, Servant will be able to auto-embed it. 
<li>Use External Emojis: Some of Servant’s commands have attached emojis, such as with the cat or meme command. 
<li>Add Reactions: Servant uses reactions heavily for the Subscribe command. Other uses of reactions involve other commands, such as the weekly command. We do not react to any of your messages, only Servant’s.
